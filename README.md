# Simon-Game
The Simon game is a classic electronic game that tests a player's memory and concentration skills. 

Here's a simple step-by-step explanation of how the Simon game works:

1. Start: Press the "A" button or any other designated button to begin the game.
2. Game Sequence: The console will light up one of the colored buttons and emit a corresponding sound. This represents the first step in the sequence.
3. Repeat the Sequence: The player must repeat the sequence by pressing the correct button in the same order. For example, if the console lights up the blue button, the player must press the blue button.
4. Correct Input: If the player presses the correct button, the console will add another step to the sequence by lighting up a different button and playing its corresponding sound.
5. Incorrect Input: If the player presses the wrong button or presses a button out of order, the game will end and the player's score will be displayed. They can then choose to play again if desired.
6. Increasing Difficulty: As the player successfully completes each sequence, the game will add an additional step, making the sequence longer and more challenging to remember.

The objective of the Simon game is to remember and replicate the longest sequence possible. It can be played individually or in a group, challenging friends or family members to see who can achieve the highest score.
